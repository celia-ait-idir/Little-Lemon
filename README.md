Little Lemon üçã
Welcome to Little Lemon, one of the first projects I created while learning front-end development!

This project showcases a clean and engaging design for a coffee and tea shop website. It highlights my growing skills in HTML and CSS, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.

You can view the design on Dribbble:

I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it! üòä
